# ACP_PROJECT_2024
This small web application originated as a project assignment for the Advanced Computer Programming exam. A simple web interface was created using HTML and CSS, and only one use case was implemented, which is User Registration in JavaScript with JQuery. The server-side was implemented using JavaScript as well, utilizing modules such as Express, HTTP, and Mongoose. The latter was used for managing a database with MongoDB.
